# GameOfLife

This is my "Game Of Life Simulator" - based on conway's game of life
implemented using Java, the graphical framework "Processing 3" and the library "ControlP5"!

Hope you have fun creating some nice worlds!

(Screenshots will follow.)

Some fonts may be not correctly shown.
I'm aware of that "system-based bug" and will fix it soon.


What do I need to run it?
-> You need "Java" installed on your computer.

How can I start it, its no ".exe"-file?
-> If you have "Java" installed, simply double click the ".jar"-file.
-> You can also open the console and type "java -jar <filename>.jar" to get debug information.



## Version Infos:

### Version 1:
- working simulation using random seeds or seeds set by user

### Version 2:
- added world editor (you can now load your own worlds, no longer random generated only)


## Planned:
- saving and loading worlds
- extended user tools for world editor
